      <h2 class="story-title">After 17 Centuries with the Dragon Council, I Humbly Submit My Resignation</h2>
      <h4 class="story-date" id="toc_1">February 2019</h4>

      <div class="comment">

      <p>There was a CEO of a prominent publishing company who resigned after 17 years in the industry. His parent company is called "Dragon" in the name. His open letter was titled "A notice about My Resignation after 17 wonderful years in the Dragon Group" or something like that. Before reading the rest of it I thought he was talking about a light novel---famous for overly long overly descriptive titles---instead of, you know, his actual resignation letter.</p>

      <p>Sure, I thought. What the hell. Let's actually make a story based on that.</p>

      <p class="date">- 2019</p></div>

      <p>Dear friends, colleagues, all the creatures from behind the Veil and, hopefully, all of Humanity to whom our decisions have intentionally and unintentionally affected.</p>
      <p>With this letter, I, the Great Dragon Valedir, humbly submit my resignation from the Council of Dragons.</p>
      <p>The Council has been a most important pillar in the growth and longevity of the planet. Within the last century alone we have prevented seven thermonuclear warfare, nine instances of global environmental catastrophes, and countless planet-threatening side effects of the irrational decisions of human leaders. Our decisions might have gone unheard to the majority of the planet, unknown to that most advanced of Earthlain lifeforms, humanities, but I’ve always believed in our cause. I’ve always believed that this world is worth fighting for, no matter the cost.</p>
      <p>But I have grown old. I know it is taboo to speak of our age–I know our immortality behooves us certain responsibilities–but I think it is time to be frank with the truth. I have grown old. I have to this world four millennia ago, and I have been a supportive member of the Council since its formation seventeen centuries ago. I, and if I may be allowed to presume, the other Great Dragons, had came into awesome powers which we have so far believed had been put to the right use.</p>
      <p>But it is one thing to lend of our powers at the occasional Hour of Need, and another thing entirely to exercise it every other day, simply because a crisis happens every other day. Three centuries ago it was simpler to decide our course of action. Crises are obvious. Discussions were short, consensus easily gained. The Unspeakable Horrors from Beyond the Void remained weak and no match to our protection. But today, today there are far too many things we have to take into account, far too many variables. In the olden days we joked of how the broken metamorphosis of single butterfly can decide the fate of an entire species. The younger ones of you will not find humour in it, for today a single broken cog in a Human-made machine can cause a war that will wipe the entire planet.</p>
      <p>And the Unspeakable Horrors. They’re weak, but cunning. I am sure you have seen the reports, how they have found cracks in our judgment. </p>
      <p>But I digress. Let this letter not be a testament to our weakness, only my own. I have grown old. I am tired. All I feel now is pain in my scales and ashes in my breath. I will be of no use to the planet if I cease to love it, and I am afraid I will lose the capability to do so if I go on. It is time for me to put my claws down.</p>
      <p>To my colleagues in the Council, I wish you luck in your future judgments and actions. </p>
      <p>And to my fellow Great Dragons, I hope our pride does not blind us to our own frailties. Immortal we might be, but we are not indestructible. If my resignation can help in reexamining our role and responsibilities in this world, then I will be glad to be of assistance.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it is time for us to move on.</p>
      <p>Perhaps, if I dare say it, it is time we let the Earthlains themselves know of the true state of the world. </p>
      <p>May consensus always be found, may the planet be safe,<br/>
      <em>Great Dragon Valedir</em></p>
